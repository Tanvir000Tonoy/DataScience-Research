## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tanvir000Tonoy/DataScience-Research.git
   cd DataScience-Research
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

### Running in Google Colab
Each notebook includes a "Open in Colab" badge for easy cloud execution. Simply click the badge at the top of any notebook to run it in Google Colab.

## Data Requirements

### Note on Data Access
Some notebooks (Week 3-5) reference external datasets. For local execution:
- Download datasets from the original sources mentioned in the notebooks
- Update file paths to point to your local data files
- Alternatively, use the provided sample data or publicly available datasets

### Sample Datasets Used
- **Week 3**: Student Performance Dataset (academic performance analysis)
- **Week 4**: Gym membership dataset (visualization exercises)  
- **Week 5**: Housing prices dataset (preprocessing pipeline)
